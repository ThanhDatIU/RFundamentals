# (PART) R Fundamentals {.unnumbered}

<p>

Learn how to code like a programmer in this beginner's track.
First, you'll learn how to work with common data structures in R like vectors, matrices, and data frames before expanding your skills by mastering conditional statements, loops, and vectorized functions.
You'll then experience the whole data science pipeline from tidying data to wrangling and visualizing data to modeling and communicating with data.
Gain exposure to each component of this pipeline from a variety of different perspectives in this tidyverse R track.

## Introduction to the Tidyverse {#explore-intro .unnumbered}

<p class="course__description">

This is an introduction to the programming language R, focused on a powerful set of tools known as the Tidyverse.
You'll learn the intertwined processes of data manipulation and visualization using the tools dplyr and ggplot2.
You'll learn to manipulate data by filtering, sorting, and summarizing a real dataset of historical country data in order to answer exploratory questions.
You'll then learn to turn this processed data into informative line plots, bar plots, histograms, and more with the ggplot2 package.
You'll get a taste of the value of exploratory data analysis and the power of Tidyverse tools.
This is a suitable introduction for those who have no previous experience in R and are interested in performing data analysis.
